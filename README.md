public class Blank : Photon.PunBehaviour

instead of mono behavior, use this to receive photon callbacks in your script.

public override void OnLeftRoom()

An example of overriding a punbehavior callback

if (!photonView.isMine)

Since all scripts attached to any game object, whether yours or theirs, runs locally. You need to check if the instance of the script is yours if you want to perform an actions. Example: when hit with laser beam, on trigger enter, check if you are the one who was hit, and if so take damage. All other players will as well do this processing and take their own damage.

     void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
            {
            
                // we dont' do anything if we are not the local player.
                if (!photonView.isMine)
                {
                    return;
                }
          }
if (PhotonNetwork.isMasterClient)

One client will be the master (automatically negotiated). The rest of the clients are slaves. If you wanted to detect some event and perform some action, it should be encapsulated in isMasterClient so that only the master performs the action, not every client connected.

Example: Load next level after match has been won. Every client will receive some event that the match has been won, but only the master will load the next level.

       if (PhotonNetwork.isMasterClient)
       {
           LoadArena();
       }
if (photonView.isMine == false && PhotonNetwork.connected == true)

Restricts input to your local instance of a player game object. Put this as an early return in Update()

      if (photonView.isMine == false && PhotonNetwork.connected == true)
      {
          return;
      }
PhotonNetwork.Instantiate

This is how you load an object in photon.

    PhotonNetwork.Instantiate(this.playerPrefab.name, new Vector3(0f, 5f, 0f), Quaternion.identity, 0);
# Photon GameObject Scripts
PhotonView

A PhotonView is what connects together the various instances on each computers, and define what components to observe and how to observe these components.

Photon Transform View

Used in combination with PhotonView to sync transform properties of an objects across clients (player avatar would want this attached)

Needs to be dragged into PhotonView as an Observed Component

https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/current/demos-and-tutorials/pun-basics-tutorial/player-networking

PhotonAnimatorView

Sync animations on an object, for example player avatar. You need to opted in every animation listed in "Synchronize Parameters" and set them to Discrete by default.

Needs to be dragged into PhotonView as an Observed Component

Discrete synchronization means that a value gets sent 10 times a second (in OnPhotonSerializeView). The receiving clients pass the value on to their local Animator.

Continuous synchronization means that the PhotonAnimatorView runs every frames. When OnPhotonSerializeView is called (10 times per second), the values recorded since the last call are sent together. The receiving client then applies the values in sequence to retain smooth transitions. While this mode is smoother, it also sends more data to achieve this effect.

# Remote Procedure Calls
Allows a player to call a method on all or some other players.

public class MyCustomRPC : Monobevaiour
{
     public void CallRemoteMethod (){
     
          if (PhotonNetwork.offlineMode == true){ //use this you need to support offline mode.
               MyRemoteMethod(PhotonTargets.Others, new object [] { 42, true });
               return;
          }
          GetComponent<PhotonView>().RPC("MyRemoteMethod", PhotonTargets.Others, new object [] { 42, true }) 
               
               //Target Types
               //PhotonTargets.Others
               //PhotonTargets.All //triggered instantly
               //PhotonTargets.AllViaServer //local client gets even through server just like everyone else
               //PhotonTargets.MasterClient
               //PhotonNetwork.playerList[0]
               //PhotonTargets.AllBuffered
               //PhotonTargets.AllBufferedViaServer //used in item pickups where could be contested which client got it first
                                                    //An important use is also when a new player connects later, they will recieve this 
                                                    //buffered event that the item has been picked up and should be removed from scene
     }
     
     [PunRPC]
     void MyRemoteMethod(int someNumber, bool someBool) {
          Debug.Log(someNumber);
          Debug.Log(someBool);
     }
}

# Scene Objects
Objects that need to be synchronized across clients but aren't owned by anyone. Technically they are owned by the master client.

The are created two ways:

Objects placed into the scene by editor and have a PhotonView
By script using PhotonNetwork.InstantiateSceneObject
     
     void PickupObject ( Health health ){
          PhotonView.RPC("OnPickup", PhotonTargets.AllBufferedViaServer, new object [] { health.PhotonView.viewId }
     }
     
     [RPC]
     protected void OnPickup( int viewId ){
          PhotonView view = PhotonView.Find( viewId);
          
     }
# PhotonNetwork.time
Used to syncronize the timing of things like projectiles across all clients.

     void Update (){
          float timePassed = (float)( PhotonNetwork.time - CreationTime ); //CreationTime also was set using PhotonNetwork.Time
          transform.position = StartPosition + transform.forward * Speed * timePassed;
          
          if (timePassed > LifeTime){
               Destroy (gameObject);
          }
          
          if (transform.position.y < 0f){
               Destroy(gameObject);
               CreateHitFx();
          }
     }
     
     void OnCollisionEnter ( Collision collision) {
          if (collsion.collider.tag == "ObjectWithStaticPositionRotationSize"){
               OnProjectileHit();
          } 
          else if ( collsion.collider.tag == "MovingObjectThatMayNotBeInPerfectSyncAcrossClients){
               //Lets the client who owns the thing that was hit make the call
               
               Ship ship = collsion.collider.GetComponent<Ship>();
               
               if (ship.Team != ProjectileOwner.Team && ship.PhotonView.isMine){
                    ship.ShipCollision.OnProjectileHit(this);
                    OnProjectileHit();  //RPC to let everyone know what happened
                    ProjectileOwner.ShipShooting.SendPorjectileHit( ProjectileId);
               }
          }
     }
# IPunObservable (streams and manual synchronization)
This lets you sync data in your hand rolled scripts. For example knowing when an enemy has fired and rendering their laser. You need to add your script in the Observed Components list in Photon View

Add to class:

      public class PlayerManager : Photon.PunBehaviour, IPunObservable{}
Use in script:

        void IPunObservable.OnPhotonSerializeView(PhotonStream stream, PhotonMessageInfo info)
        {
            if (stream.isWriting)
            {
                // We own this player: send the others our data
                //This script is local, you write to stream
                stream.SendNext(IsFiring);
                stream.SendNext(17.8f); //the scructure of send and receive will match so you can send multiple things 
                                        //and receive them in that order
            }
            else
            {
                // Network player, receive data
                //This script is receiving data from remote players script
                this.IsFiring = (bool)stream.ReceiveNext();
                this.SomethingElse = (float)stream.ReceiveNext();
                
                LastNetworkDataReceivedTime = info.timestamp; //the stream is outdated due to lag so we need to know the time past since
                                                              //it was sent. This is used to modify time based things on local instances
                                                              //This is used for prediction models like position
                                                              //This should also be used in combination with PhotonNetwork.GetPing();
            }
        }
This is confusing but remember to think of this as an instance not a singleton. If there are 2 players in the game, one is you and one is the remote player.

Your instance of this script is always going to write. Example: you're firing or your health decreased, the instance of the script on YOUR avatar will write this data.

If a remote player loses health, the instance of this script on THEIR avatar will receive data that was written by them on their client.

The If/else conditions arent both hit in the same instance... one will always be hit in your instance and the other will always be hit in their instance.
